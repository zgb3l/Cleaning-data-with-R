# Getting the data:

if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "./data/Dataset.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "./data/Dataset.zip", exdir = "./data")

# Creating R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

# (1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# 1.1 Reading files + training tables:

x_train <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
y_train <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
subject_train <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")

# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
# with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
